**Java trace**
  - Java: `LreController.java`:134-147

**Fix directive**
An event-triggered branch followed by a TRIGGERLESS branch in the same else-if chain has no counterpart in RoboChart: the Java takes only the first branch, but the extracted transitions form an unguarded external choice and the triggerless one is enabled whenever its data guard holds — including when the event is present. RoboChart has no event-absence guard.

## Next step
Preflight found structural rule violations (errors). Fix them before continuing — downstream phases would either crash or produce a silently-wrong formal model.
