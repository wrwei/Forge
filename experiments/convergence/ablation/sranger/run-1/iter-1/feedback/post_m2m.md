## Issues
### Issue 1: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SRangerController.Moving

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SRangerController.Moving: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback � Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail). Add an unconditional else-branch in the Java mode block.
```

**Fix directive**
Add an `else { mode = <SameMode>; }` clause to the inner if-else chain of this mode block so the state has at least one bare-precondition outgoing transition. Without it, the Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail (see CLAUDE.md "Isabelle/UTP Z-Machine `deadlock_free` proof" gotcha).

### Issue 2: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SRangerController.Turning

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SRangerController.Turning: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback � Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail). Add an unconditional else-branch in the Java mode block.
```

**Fix directive**
Add an `else { mode = <SameMode>; }` clause to the inner if-else chain of this mode block so the state has at least one bare-precondition outgoing transition. Without it, the Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail (see CLAUDE.md "Isabelle/UTP Z-Machine `deadlock_free` proof" gotcha).

### Issue 3: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SRangerController.Halted

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SRangerController.Halted: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback � Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail). Add an unconditional else-branch in the Java mode block.
```

**Fix directive**
Add an `else { mode = <SameMode>; }` clause to the inner if-else chain of this mode block so the state has at least one bare-precondition outgoing transition. Without it, the Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail (see CLAUDE.md "Isabelle/UTP Z-Machine `deadlock_free` proof" gotcha).
