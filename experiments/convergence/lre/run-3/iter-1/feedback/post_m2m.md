## Issues
### Issue 1: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.OCM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.OCM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback �� Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail). Add an unconditional else-branch in the Java mode block.
```

**Fix directive**
Add an `else { mode = <SameMode>; }` clause to the inner if-else chain of this mode block so the state has at least one bare-precondition outgoing transition. Without it, the Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail (see CLAUDE.md "Isabelle/UTP Z-Machine `deadlock_free` proof" gotcha).

### Issue 2: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.MOM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.MOM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback �� Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail). Add an unconditional else-branch in the Java mode block.
```

**Fix directive**
Add an `else { mode = <SameMode>; }` clause to the inner if-else chain of this mode block so the state has at least one bare-precondition outgoing transition. Without it, the Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail (see CLAUDE.md "Isabelle/UTP Z-Machine `deadlock_free` proof" gotcha).

### Issue 3: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.HCM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.HCM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback �� Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail). Add an unconditional else-branch in the Java mode block.
```

**Fix directive**
Add an `else { mode = <SameMode>; }` clause to the inner if-else chain of this mode block so the state has at least one bare-precondition outgoing transition. Without it, the Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail (see CLAUDE.md "Isabelle/UTP Z-Machine `deadlock_free` proof" gotcha).

### Issue 4: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.CAM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.CAM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback �� Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail). Add an unconditional else-branch in the Java mode block.
```

**Fix directive**
Add an `else { mode = <SameMode>; }` clause to the inner if-else chain of this mode block so the state has at least one bare-precondition outgoing transition. Without it, the Isabelle deadlock_free proof will fail (see CLAUDE.md "Isabelle/UTP Z-Machine `deadlock_free` proof" gotcha).
