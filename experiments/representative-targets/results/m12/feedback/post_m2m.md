## Issues
### Issue 1: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M1

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M1: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 2: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M2

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M2: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 3: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M3

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M3: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 4: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M4

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M4: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 5: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M5

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M5: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 6: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M6

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M6: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 7: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M7

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M7: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 8: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M8

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M8: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 9: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: SynController.M9

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] SynController.M9: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```
