## Issues
### Issue 1: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: GasAnalysisController.READING

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] GasAnalysisController.READING: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 2: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: GasAnalysisController.ANALYSING

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] GasAnalysisController.ANALYSING: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 3: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: GasAnalysisController.NO_GAS

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] GasAnalysisController.NO_GAS: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 4: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: GasAnalysisController.GAS_DETECTED

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] GasAnalysisController.GAS_DETECTED: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 5: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: GasAnalysisController.CONCLUDED

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] GasAnalysisController.CONCLUDED: no outgoing transitions (terminal state; the Isabelle generator exempts it from deadlock-freedom)
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 6: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.WAITING

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.WAITING: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 7: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.GOING

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.GOING: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 8: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.FOUND

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.FOUND: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 9: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.AVOIDING

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.AVOIDING: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 10: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.TRYING_AGAIN

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.TRYING_AGAIN: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 11: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.AVOIDING_AGAIN

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.AVOIDING_AGAIN: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 12: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.GETTING_OUT

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.GETTING_OUT: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 13: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: MovementController.HALTED

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] MovementController.HALTED: no outgoing transitions (terminal state; the Isabelle generator exempts it from deadlock-freedom)
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.
