### Issue 1: lint_rule8_event_branch_precedes_triggerless — LreController.step(): triggerless branch guarded by 'inOpez' follows event-triggered branch(es): event instanceof lre.event.InputEvent.ReqOCM, event instanceof lre.event.InputEvent.EndTask, event instanceof lre.event.InputEvent.ReqHCM — in the extracted model both are enabled together

**Java trace**
  - Java: `LreController.java`:108-127

**Fix directive**
An event-triggered branch followed by a TRIGGERLESS branch in the same else-if chain has no counterpart in RoboChart: the Java takes only the first branch, but the extracted transitions form an unguarded external choice and the triggerless one is enabled whenever its data guard holds — including when the event is present. Trigger disjointness does NOT close this (it only separates two EVENT-triggered branches), and the negation synthesis that closes rule6 cannot either, because the event-triggered branch contributes no data predicate to negate. RoboChart has no event-absence guard, so this must be fixed in the Java: either give the later branch an explicit guard that excludes the earlier branch's case, or place the triggerless branch FIRST so the ordinary priority-negation synthesis applies. Otherwise the model admits two operations in states where the Java is deterministic.

Branches below a triggerless guarded branch must textually carry the negation of each preceding triggerless guard (e.g. 'else if (queueLong && !waitAboveLimit)'). Relying on the implicit priority of else-if produces a formal model whose operations can fire nondeterministically — the extracted preconditions are not mutually exclusive. Conjoin '&& !<guard>' for each guard listed above.

Annotate with @RoboChartType("real"). Without the annotation, the formal model extraction cannot confidently map Java double to RoboChart real and may produce an incorrect model type. See java_codegen_rules.txt.

## Next step
Preflight found structural rule violations (errors). Fix them before continuing — downstream phases would either crash or produce a silently-wrong formal model.
