# 4 — Model-to-Model (ETL Transformation) — PASSED

## Summary

## Run history
- New this run: 0
- Recurring from previous run: 4
- Resolved since previous run: 0

## Issues
### Issue 1: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.OCM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.OCM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 2: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.MOM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.MOM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 3: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.HCM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.HCM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.

### Issue 4: deadlock_lint_warning — State without unconditional fallback: LreController.CAM [recurring x2]

**Raw**
```
[deadlock-lint] LreController.CAM: all outgoing transitions are guarded or event-triggered (no unconditional fallback; the Isabelle generator adds an idle operation for the remaining cases, so no change is needed).
```

**Fix directive**
This state has no unconditional outgoing transition. The Isabelle generator represents the remaining cases by an idle operation, so the deadlock-freedom obligation does not depend on this; no change is required.
